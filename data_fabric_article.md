# Building an Open-Source Data Fabric Architecture (with Docker Starter Stack)
*Unlock unified data access, lineage tracking, and governance using Apache tools.*

## What is a Data Fabric?
A **Data Fabric** is not a product, but a **design pattern** — a way of enabling seamless, secure, and real-time data access across distributed and heterogeneous data sources through a unified layer.

It's about **connecting data silos**, ensuring **metadata awareness**, and delivering **governance, lineage**, and **interoperability** — whether in the cloud, on-premises, or hybrid environments.

## Key Concepts: Cataloging & Lineage

### Data Cataloging
This is the process of **documenting all your data assets**: what they are, where they live, how they're used. Think of it as an intelligent inventory of all your data tables, APIs, files, etc.

**Why it matters:**
- Helps teams discover and trust data.
- Prevents duplication and silos.
- Enables metadata-driven automation.

### Data Lineage
Data lineage shows **how data flows** — from source to destination, including every transformation step.

**Why it matters:**
- Essential for debugging, auditing, and compliance.
- Ensures trust in dashboards and reports.
- Makes complex data pipelines transparent.

## 1. Apache Atlas + Apache NiFi – Open Data Fabric Starter

### Apache Atlas
- Enterprise-grade metadata management and **lineage visualization**.  
- REST API and native integration with NiFi, Hive, Kafka, etc.  
- Supports tagging, classifications, and data policies.

### Apache NiFi
- Flow-based visual data orchestration (ETL, ELT, streaming).  
- Offers connectors for databases, filesystems, cloud, APIs.  
- Supports real-time event processing.

### How They Work Together

```
        +-------------------+
        | Apache Atlas      |
        | Metadata & Lineage|
        +---------+---------+
                  |
                  |
        +---------v---------+
        |   Apache NiFi     |   <-- Flow-based data movement
        +---------+---------+
                  |
      +-----------+-----------+
      |     Data Sources       |
      | (DBs, APIs, Files...)  |
      +------------------------+
```

NiFi can emit lineage metadata to Atlas automatically, enabling you to see end-to-end data flows.

## 2. Commercial Option: Talend Data Fabric

- Offers a **free** open-source ETL tool (Talend Open Studio).
- Talend Cloud includes a full data fabric platform.
- Can be combined with other open-source tools for hybrid architectures.

## 3. Other Tools to Build a Data Fabric

| **Component**        | **Tools**                             |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Metadata / Lineage   | Apache Atlas, Amundsen                 |
| Data Orchestration   | Apache NiFi, Airflow, Dagster          |
| Data Catalog         | Amundsen, DataHub                      |
| Data Movement        | NiFi, Kafka, Debezium                  |
| Data Virtualization  | Presto / Trino                         |
| Governance / Security| OPA, Apache Ranger                    |

## Real-World Use Case

Imagine a system replicating data from PostgreSQL into Snowflake, MongoDB, and Blockchain nodes.

With Data Fabric:
- **NiFi** handles multi-target replication in real time.
- **Atlas** tracks who accessed which dataset and how it was transformed.
- **Trino** queries everything like a **single virtual database**.
- **OPA** enforces centralized access rules across systems.

## Docker Starter Stack (Open-Source)

We’ve prepared a fully dockerized Data Fabric starter kit, including:
- Apache NiFi  
- Apache Atlas  
- Kafka (for lineage and events)  
- Trino (for query federation)  
- PostgreSQL (sample source)  
- Preconfigured metadata integration

You can use this architecture locally or extend it to Kubernetes (Helm support coming soon).
